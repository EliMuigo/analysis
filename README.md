<b>Analyzing the performance of an Airbnb listing involves looking at various aspects to understand what to expect.</b>


# The Analysis
1.Compare the listing's price to similar listings in area.

2.Examine the quantity and quality of reviews of different Airbnb's listings.

3.Show peak bookings of different airbnb's

4.Determine availability throughout the year and when they are in demand.

5.Which Airbnb has the highest demand 

6.The Airbnb's prices from expensive to cheapest.
   
   ## In the Airbnb Analysis  we will differentiate between using linear regression model and Random Forest Model and which is better.

   <b>-Linear Regression:</b>
   Assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.Helps to understand and predict the relatiosnhip between various factors(independent variables)and the price of Airbnb bookings(the dependent variable). Aims at establishing a linear equation that describes this relationship.
   It provides coefficients that indicate the direction and magnitude of the effect each feature has on target variable. It can be useful when you wnat to quantify and explain the impact of each feature on price.

    1. Data Collection-gather relevant data that includes inforamtion about the Airbnb listings, such as the number of bedrooms, location, amenities, reviews, host information.
    2. Data Processing-Involves handling missing values, dealing with outliers and encoding categorical variables(room type, loaction) into numerical format using technique like one-hot encoding.
    3. Feature Selection-Choose the features(independent variables) that can impact the Airbnb booking price. The selection is based on data exploration and statistical methods.
    4. Formulating Linear Regression Model- Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between independent variables and dependent variable.
    5. Model Training-use the collected data to estimate the coefficients that minimize the difference between predicted prices and actual prices. 
    6. Model Evaluation-Evaluate the performance of linear regression model using appropriate metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error . This helps assess how well the model fits the data and makes accurate predictions.
    7. Prediction-Use the trained linear regression model to make price predictions for new Airbnb listings.

<b>-The Random Forest Model</b> uses the same steps to analyse data as the linear regression. The Random Forest Model is used in handling complex, non-linear relationships and handling mix of different types of features.
Random Forest is useful to capture a wide range of patterns in the data, making it suitable for complex datasets with diverse feature types.

<b>-<u>NOTE:</u></b>

.To determine which model to use between Random Forest and Linear Regression you have to consider the following factors.
 
    1.Business Context- What are the key objectives of your analysis. Is it to understand the customer preference or segment your audience.
    2.Data size-The size of your data can influence. Random Forest perfomrs well with larger datasets with high dimensionality while Linear Regression performs well with smaller datasets.
    3.Data Exploration-Analyze your dataset to understand the relationship between features and the target variables. If you observe linear relationship Linear Regression can be used. For non-linear and complex patterns Random Forest is used.
    4.Model Goals- determine your goals for the analyis. If you need insights into how individual features impact prices Linear regresison is more suitable.If the goal is prediction then Random Forest is suitable.
